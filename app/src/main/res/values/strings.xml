        "Here's a simple strawberry smoothie recipe for you! 🍓🥤\n\n"
        "Ingredients:
        - 1 cup fresh or frozen strawberries
        - 1 banana (for natural sweetness and creaminess)
        - ½ cup Greek yogurt (or any yogurt of choice)
        - ½ cup milk (dairy or plant-based)
        - 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup (optional)
        - ½ tsp vanilla extract (optional)
        - ½ cup ice cubes (if using fresh strawberries)\n\n"

        "Instructions:
        1. Prepare the Ingredients – Wash the strawberries thoroughly and remove the green tops. If using fresh strawberries, cut them into halves for easier blending. Peel the banana and chop it into smaller pieces.\n
        2. Add to Blender – In a blender, add the strawberries, banana, yogurt, and milk. These form the base of your smoothie.\n
        3. Sweeten (If Needed) – If you prefer a sweeter smoothie, add honey or maple syrup. This step is optional as the banana provides natural sweetness.\n
        4. Enhance the Flavor – Add vanilla extract for an extra layer of flavor. This enhances the taste without overpowering the fruit.\n
        5. Add Ice (Optional) – If using fresh strawberries instead of frozen ones, add ice cubes to chill the smoothie and give it a refreshing texture.\n
        6. Blend Until Smooth – Secure the blender lid and blend on high speed for 30–60 seconds or until the mixture is smooth and creamy. If the consistency is too thick, add a little more milk and blend again.\n
        7. Taste and Adjust – Before serving, taste the smoothie. If it's too thick, add more liquid. If you want it sweeter, add more honey or fruit. Blend again if necessary.\n
        8. Serve Immediately – Pour the smoothie into a glass and enjoy it fresh. For an extra special touch, garnish with sliced strawberries or a sprinkle of chia seeds.\n\n\n"

        "Understanding the Process:
        - A smoothie is all about balance—choosing the right ingredients to achieve a creamy, flavorful, and nutritious drink. The banana adds natural sweetness and thickness, while yogurt provides a creamy texture and a boost of protein. Adding vanilla extract enhances the flavor, while optional sweeteners can adjust the taste to your preference. Blending everything together ensures a smooth consistency, and ice helps to make it cold and refreshing. The best part? You can customize the smoothie by adding extras like chia seeds, protein powder, or even a handful of spinach for a nutritional boost! Enjoy your homemade strawberry smoothie! 🍓✨"
